    "# Coursework 2: Clinical image classification\n",
    "\n",
    "In this coursework, we will work on a clinical imaging dataset. The dataset comes from ISIC (International Skin Imaging Collaboration) 2016 Challenge. It consists of 900 skin lesion images, categorised into two classes: malignant (melanoma) and benign, as shown here.\n",
    "\n",
    "![](melanoma_vs_benign.jpg)\n",
    "\n",
    "To faciliate this coursework, we have pre-processed the images for you, including resizing the original images to a standard size of 64 by 64, splitting into a training set and a test set, so you simply need to focus on the visualisation and classification work. Your task here is to read the imaging data and train a model that classifies between benign and malignant images.\n",
    "\n",
    "Hint: This coursework is similar to the hand digit classification problem you have just learnt at class. It is a transition from data management to data analysis. You will use a machine learning library, sklearn, and we have provided guidance in this coursework. We will assess the proper implementation of the whole pipeline, but not the classification accuracy. Just have fun!\n",
    "\n",
    "In the next term, you will learn more about machine learning, what each of the model mentioned here does and how to improve the classification performance."
