    "\n",
    "In this practical, you will be given two datasets, a clinical dataset and a query dataset. The datasets were adapted from \\[1\\] but with the age information modified. Also, the original dataset contains 100,000 subjects. Here, we have already reduced the number of subjects in the datasets so that you do not need to wait for a long time while running the practical on your laptop.\n",
